## üî∞ Introduction

The `commons` library provides re-usable components and utilities for your Java project. The implementation is lightweight yet still feature-rich and requires no external run-time dependencies. While the project is targeting Java 8 to maintain compatability
with most projects it still focuses on modern and fluent implementations that allow you to streamline your code style.

Make sure to check out the project's [wiki page][wiki_page] for details regarding the available features as well as code examples.
